      <question>Where did OpenClinica come from?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          OpenClinica was created by a group of software developers who were tired
          of wasting their time fiddling around with builds and wanted to get
          down to brass tacks and actually develop software!

      <question>Why is OpenClinica so wildly popular?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          OpenClinica saves you so much time in your software development efforts that
          you will have time to learn a second language, relax ten hours a
          day, and train for that marathon you've always wanted to run!
