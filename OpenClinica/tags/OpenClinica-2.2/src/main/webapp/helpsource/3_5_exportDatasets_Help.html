	<h1>3.5 Export Datasets Help</h1>

	<p>    This section allows you to view or download the data in your study based on a dataset design you have created and saved. You are presented with a graphical model as well as written instructions detailing the five steps that need to be taken in order to complete the entire process. Please click the <em>Proceed to <a href="3_2_createDataset_Help.html">Create Dataset</a></em> button to begin the process. </p>

	<p>You can access your dataset in one of the 4 currently available formats - HTML, tab-delimited text, comma-delimited text, or SPSS format. </p>

	<p>Data may be viewed online in HTML format. Study Events and <a href="5_4_administerCRF_Help.html">CRF</em></a> for each event that you selected when designing the dataset are shown in the left side information panel. You can click on column headers to see the complete "metadata", (i.e. the properties) of that particular variable.</p>
	
	<p><a name="downloadsettings"><strong>Browser Settings for Downloading Files</strong></a></p>
	<p>There are two important settings you should know about to make sure you are able to download files from OpenClinica:
	<p>1. <em>Popups</em>: OpenClinica uses popups to provide information about a data file before you save it to your disk. When you click on a link to download a data file, please be sure you have any popup blockers turned off.
	<p>2. <em>Internet Explorer Bug</em>: OpenClinica is often configured to work over a secure SSL internet connection (this is the recommended configuration). If your installation of OpenClinica is set up this way, you will see a 'lock' icon on the browser and the URL will start with 'https://'. <br>
	<p>Due to a bug in Internet Explorer, some users of that web browser will have difficulty downloading files over SSL. To fix this, you must change your browser Internet Options. Take the following steps:</p>
	<ol><li>Go to 'Tools -> Internet Options'
	<li>Click on the 'Advanced' tab at the top of the dialog box.
	<li>Scroll down to the section called 'Security'.
	<li>Find the line entitled 'Do not save encrypted pages to disk'.
	<li>Check the box on this line.
	<li>Click 'OK'
	</ol>
	You should now be able to download files from OpenClinica.

	<p><a name="downloadingfiles"><strong>Downloading and Saving Files</strong></a></p>

	<p>If you choose one of the downloadable file formats, you will see a popup window with information on the newly generated file. Click on the name of the file to download it. Select a place to save the file locally. The file is a .zip file, and may be extracted using an 'unzip' program such as WinZip. 

	<p><em>SPSS File Format:</em></p> 
	When downloading SPSS files, you will save a zip file that contains two different files: a .dat file, which is a tab-delimited data file, and a .sps file, which is an SPSS data definition script. Open the .sps file in SPSS. If you have put the .sps file in a different folder from the associated data file, you will have to change the FILE location in the .sps file to point to the physical location of your data file. Select 'Run -> All' from the SPSS menu and your data will be loaded into SPSS.<br>
	<b>NOTE:</b> The SPSS data format provided has been tested for SPSS 13.0 and up.
	</p>
    <p><a href="3_6_spssSpec_Help.html">See 3.6 SPSS Syntax File Specifications.</a></p>
	<p><em>Archive of Exported Files</em></p>
	<p>At the bottom of the screen, you may see a table of previously downloaded files. You can access any of the files in this archive. The list displays the date, where the file was created as well as who created it and the file size.<br>
